## Step 1: Collect Substance
Start with strong insights from sales calls, industry trends, and customer pain points in Toronto and Canada. Keep a log of questions and ideas.

## Step 4: Test & Iterate
Run a one-month sprint to try different formats and storytelling styles. Track what works best for Toronto and Canadian audiences.
