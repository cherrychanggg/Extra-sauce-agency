## TL;DR
- Focus on one platform before expanding.
- Test different content styles and formats.
- Build around clear content pillars.
- Optimize your process and storytelling.
- Invest in founder-led video for credibility.

## Why Most Founders Struggle
Most founders try to be everywhere at once. Instead, master one platform—like LinkedIn—before scaling to others. This builds authority and makes future expansion easier.

## Step 1: Collect Substance
Start with strong insights from sales calls, industry trends, and customer pain points. Keep a log of questions and ideas.

## Step 2: Define Your Narrative
Frame your content around a bigger industry shift, not just your product. Make your company part of a movement.

## Step 3: Content Pillars
Organize posts into four categories: solution, expertise, company story, and personal journey. Focus mostly on solution and expertise.

## Step 4: Test & Iterate
Run a one-month sprint to try different formats and storytelling styles. Track what works best.

## Step 5: Master One Platform
Avoid burnout and diluted messaging. Pick one platform, optimize your process, then scale.

## Step 6: Use Video
Video builds trust and boosts reach. Start a founder-led video series once you have traction.

## Final Thoughts
Start now—collect substance, define your narrative, build pillars, test, master one platform, and use video. Founders who go all in on content will own their market.
